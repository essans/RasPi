Introduction
============
The ambition behind this project is to use the relatively inexpensive Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SCB) as the basis for reinforcing my understanding of topcis relating to computer architechure, networking, security, physical computing, programming, and other things I'll stumble upon and learn along the way.

Why the raspberry-pi ?

Our home has a mac computers, windows computers, mobile devices.  I have accounts with GCP, AWS and Azure that give me access to cloud storage, compute, databases, ML tools and a lot more.  I can spin-up machines in umpteen configurations and then pause them, or switch them off and trash them when I'm done.

At work I have access to a powerful workstation under my desk, internal cloud-compute environments, and a state-of-the art datascience platform.  

So, why bother tinkering with a low-powered devices that will always underperform versus these alternatives?

Well, it is the learning process.  Learning for learning's sake, and enjoyment.  And knowing that what I'll learn will benefit me beyond the raspberry-pi.  

Not to mention that the cost of error is low.  Worse case I'll mess-up a single-board-computer that costs fifty dollars, rather than one that costs thousands.  And if I mess-up the configurations?  Well I'll wipe the SD card that a raspberry-pi uses for storage of both its OS and data and start again!  

Have you ever tinkered with a computer, or installed some new software, or a driver, and then ruined your set-up? and then spent the next 8-hours trying to roll-everythig back or fix the problem?  We've all been there.... 

The raspberry-pi is cheap.  It is also fun to tinker with :)
