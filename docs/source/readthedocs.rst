Creation of these docs
======================
In creating a set of recipes for use on the raspberry-pi my goal was to document things along the way which for me is a long established habit for whenever setting up a new computer, noting down a new piece of code, or script for future use, or a technique for solving a problem. 

I am a voracious note taker, whether it is handwritten in a notebook (I'm a big fan of the `Barron Fig <http://www.barronfig.com/>`_ Vanguard softcover notebooks - always dot grid), and I use a combination of Evernote and private github repositories.

For my raspberry-pi projects I want to experiment with documenting things on the web.  I started with a collection of markdown and code pages in a public github repository but it wasn't very organized.  

I've always likeed the "read the docs" theme for technical documentation and my thinking is that maybe it will work for documenting what I now call a collection of recipes for the raspberry-pi.  

This section documents how I'm going about doing this.  A recipe in and of itself.
