Introduction
============

The ambition behind this project is to use the relatively inexpensive Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SCB) as the basis for building computing clusters of varying configurations.

Given the availability of ample storage and compute resources (with zero footprint) from the major cloud providers, I'm under no illusions that the capability of these cluster is going to be serverly limited.  

But in doing this I will reinforce my understanding of distributed computing and also more broadly I'll learn a few things about linux networking, remote server management, physical computing etc.  Not to mention I'll hopefully sharpen my coding/scripting skills.
