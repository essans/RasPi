Introduction
============

The ambition behind this project is to use the relatively inexpensive Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SCB) as the basis for building computing clusters of varying configurations in order to reinforce my understanding of distributed computing.  But the objective is to also learn a few things about linux networking, remote server management, physical computing etc, and to sharpen my coding/scipting skills by trying something that is different from what I normally do.
