Introduction
============
The ambition behind this project is to use the relatively inexpensive Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SCB) as the basis for reinforcing my understanding of vaarious topics relating to computer architechure, networking, security, physical computing, programming, and other things I'll stumble upon and hopefully learn along the way.

Why the raspberry-pi ?

At home I use an imac or a macbook. I have access to windows via bootcamp. I have accounts with GCP, AWS and Azure that give me access to cloud storage, compute resources, databases, ML tools and a lot more.  I can spin-up machines in umpteen configurations and then pause them, or switch them off completely and and discard when I'm done.

At work I have access to a powerful workstation under my desk which i can remote into from almost anywhere. I have access to internal virtual machines, cloud-compute environments, and a state-of-the art datascience platform.  

So, why bother tinkering with raspberry-pis which are low-powered devices that will always underperform versus these alternatives?

Well, it is the learning process.  Learning for learning's sake, and enjoyment.  And knowing that what I'll learn will benefit me beyond the raspberry-pi.  

Not to mention that the cost of error is low.  Worse case I'll fry a single-board-computer that costs fifty dollars, rather than one that costs thousands.  And if I mess-up the configurations and settings?  Well, I can wipe the SD card that a raspberry-pi uses for storage of both its OS and data and start again!  

Tinkering with a with a computer, installing new operating systems, software, or even a driver, can ruin an existing set-up resulting in the next 8-hours trying to roll-everythig back and hopefully fixing the problem.  I think we've all been there...

The raspberry-pi is cheap.  It is also fun to tinker with :)
