What is this?
-------------
This is the documentation for a collection of recipes, code and hacks for the raspberry pi.


What are the objectives
-----------------------
Show how the relatively inexpensive Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SCB) can be used to learn and/or reinforce understanding of a wide range of topics relating to computer architechure, networking, security, physical computing, programming, and related topics.


Why the Raspberry Pi?
---------------------
The cost of entry is low allowing for the purchase dozens of boards in order to experiment and build with.  The cost of error is also low.  Worse case a computer costing $50 will be ruined.  A misconfiguered device with settings that cannot be rolled-back is easy to recover from as the SD card that a raspberry-pi uses for storage of both its OS and data can be wiped and another attempt made.

Experimenting and tinkering with a with a full price computer, installing new operating systems, software, or even a driver, can ruin an existing set-up resulting in hours or days attempting to recover and hopefully fixing the problem.


Why the elaborate documentation?
--------------------------------
The purpose is to document the objectives, sequence of steps, and the outcome in a way that is memorialized for future reference.  I want everything to be replicable.

In doing so I'll hopefully improve how I document things and learn about ReStructuredText (.rst) markup syntax for technical documentation.
